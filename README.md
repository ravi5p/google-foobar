# google-foobar

Haven't heard of Google Foobar yet? Its Google secret hiring process; as its secret you won't see Google talk about it anywhere. If you're interested to know more, please see [here](https://thehustle.co/the-secret-google-interview-that-landed-me-a-job) someone describing the way it helped him get into Google.

If you're struck and a search engine landed you here, though I made sure not use any keywords from Challenge problem statements, I suggest not to read through solutions right away. Try to see if you can get to find pages where people give meaningful hints that help you solve it. Use this space as a last resort to help debug your solution.

Happy Coding!
